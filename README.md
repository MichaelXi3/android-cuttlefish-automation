# Android Cuttlefish Virtual Device Launch Automation

## Command

```bash
source ./create-android-cuttlefish.sh
```

## SideNote

In Step 2 of the process, your laptop will reboot. Once the reboot is complete, simply execute the shell script again. The progress will be tracked, and previously completed commands will not be re-run.

The reason for the reboot is that it will trigger the installation of additional kernel modules and the application of udev rules.
